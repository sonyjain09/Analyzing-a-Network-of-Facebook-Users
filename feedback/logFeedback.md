Week 3/28: Please make sure to redo your proposal feedback. I had put the feedback on a separate branch but I realize it may not have been apparent. Furthermore, I did put a GitHub issue so please make sure to check these places as well. In the future, any critical to do items will be sent through a GitHub issue.

Week 4/4: Also now that I think about it a bit more, your previous algorithm would make sense if you take the opposite definition of your edges (aka each edge represents if you're NOT friends). Make sure to either send me a message on Discord or email to setup a Mid-Project checkin this following week. Preferably I want to see at least one working of your three algorithms (probably for you it would be BFS) or parsing and some simple tests for it. Also do not use absolute paths, use only relative paths or I cannot run it. One more thing: use `using std::...` in your files please. Make sure you are on track for the mid-project checkin! Thanks!

Week 4/11: Make sure you guys speed up and reach out. Kosaraju and SP might take a hot second so try to finish Dijkstra up ASAP. By next week look to have finished Dijkstra and at least half of Shortest Path.

Week 4/18: Sounds fine just make sure you keep hashing through it. Let me know if you need any help.

Week 4/25: Nice! Let me know if you want me to look at your code.
