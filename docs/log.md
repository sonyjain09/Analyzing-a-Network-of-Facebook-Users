Week 3/28: This week our goal was to read the data and create an adjacency matrix to be able to read it efficiently, which we were able to accomplish. Because there was only one main assignment for this weekâ€™s work, each team member did not exactly accomplish any specific tasks. Rather, we all called and worked on it together while one person screenshared. (This is also why there are only commits from one person.) For next week, we hope to work on the DFS algorithm and test our code more thoroughly.

Week 4/4: This week our goal was to work on the BFS algorithm (we changed from DFS to BFS) while testing. We made a Person class, Network class, BFS class and Graph Traversal class. By doing this we were able to split up work nicely. We also corrected our Final Project proposal based on the feedback we were given and changed some of the ways we were approaching the algorithms. We also began writing tests for BFS. For next week, we hope to fix any bugs with BFS and began working on our find shortest path algorithm.

Week 4/11: This week we finished BFS and wrote tests to make sure it was functional and did not have any errors. We also began working on the shortest path algorithm. Three of us were focused on debugging and testing BFS, and one of us began looking into Dijkstra's algorithm and how to best implement that. For next week, we hope to fully implement shortest path, and hopefully also begin looking into Kosaraju's algorithm to see how to work with friend groups within our data.

Week 4/18: This week we re-structured our whole project and redid testing for each class we had made. We started coding dijkstras algorithm but haven't been able to make it pass all test cases yet. We also have been discussing what we want to do for our 3rd algorithm because we're not sure if strongly connected components makes sense for our data. Next we plan to finish dijkstra's and try to finish our third algorithm.

Week 4/25: This week we finished kruskals and tested it. We also finished shortest paths which we will use for betweeness centrality and have tested it a little. Next week we plan to finish betweeness centrality and test and also put everything together. We plan to work on the readme, written report and final presentation.
