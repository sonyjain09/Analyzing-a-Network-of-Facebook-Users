Communication
Team Meetings: Our team plans to meet twice a week: Tuesdays from 7-9 PM and 
Wednesdays 7-8:30 PM. We will meet in person at CIF for all of these meetings.
To keep records, we will continuously work on a google document, noting what we 
accomplished in each meeting and what we have to do for our next meeting. We will 
also use this google document for reminders and work distribution.
Assistance: We have a group chat on iMessage where we will contact each other for
questions and opinions. Members in the group chat are expected to respond within 
half an hour because most of us check our phones pretty often.
Respect: Everyone in our group is friends and we have all worked on a group project 
in the past. We are all comfortable enough with each other that we will always speak up 
if we have an issue. We also will ensure to reflect on our progress after every team meeting and 
ask all four members if there is anything we need to discuss. If someone is either not contributing 
or not listening, we feel comfortable enough to speak to the person directly and verbally work 
through the issue.


Collaboration
Work Distribution: At the beginning of each meeting, we will look at our goal for the week and then 
assign work to each person for the week. If we meet unexpected complications or unforeseen work we 
will re-evaluate our weekly goal and re-distribute work to each team member. If needed, we will extend
 our meeting times to 10 PM because we are all free until that time on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. 
Time Commitment: Because our weekly meetings add up to three and a half per week, each member is expected 
to contribute two and a half hours per week to the project estimating an hour per week dedicated to 
planning out and distributing work. We all accounted for prior time commitments when scheduling these 
meetings and cross-checked with our weekly schedules including classes and extracurricular activities. 
When new conflicts or commitments occur, we will handle it depending on the situation. If someone simply
can’t attend the meeting, we will get on a Discord meeting with them so that we can screen share and video 
chat to help each other with problems effectively. If someone entirely can’t contribute to the meeting during 
the planned meeting times, we will let them know of the work we distributed to them for the week and all of 
us will be available through iMessage to answer any of their questions once they do get a chance to do their 
part of the weekly goal. If more than two people are not able to attend the meeting, we will either meet on 
Sundays at 2 pm, or if the week’s work is something we expect to be comfortable with, we will cancel the 
weekly meeting and work on the project for the given hours on our own.
Conflict Resolution: When there is a disagreement between members, we will group Facetime each other on 
the iMessage group chat and ensure that everyone is on the group call. This way, we can see each other
while working through the issue verbally and all members are on the same page. If one or members have not 
accomplished their tasks, the rest of the team will come together and talk to the person and make the issue 
clear. We will work through why the person was not able to get the work done and what the rest of the group 
can do to help that person out. If the person does not have a good excuse like them simply being lazy, we 
will speak to them directly and remind them of our team contract and their responsibility to the group 
project. In the situation where one or members are habitually late, we will try to work around their 
schedule a little better so that they no longer need to be late. If this does not fix the issue, we 
will ensure that they are still working on the team project for the expected duration and as long as 
the other members on the team and doing their part to meet the weekly goal. Another hypothetical situation 
we wanted to address is if we start falling behind on weekly deadlines as a group. In this situation, we will 
extend our weekly meetings until 10 PM and dedicate more of our free times to meeting the weekly goals. We 
have also considered working on other CS 225 work together outside of this project so that we collectively 
get our work for the class done in a timely manner and so that we can maximize our time towards the final 
project.
